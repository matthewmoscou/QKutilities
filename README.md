# QKutilities
A set of scripts for parsing bioinformatic data.

## Scripts
### Sequence and annotation
*QKutilities_FASTA_length.py* reads a FASTA file and reports the lengths of all sequences.

*QKutilities_fasta_subset.py* reads a FASTA file and a list of identifiers and exports the subset.

*QKutilities_GFA_to_FASTA.py* converts a GFA file into FASTA format.

*QKutilities_protein_analysis.py* performs a window-based frequency analysis of a protein sequence for all 20 amino acids.

*QKutilities_select_gff3.py* will export a region from a FASTA and GFF3 file.

*QKutilities_trim_reads.py* trims and size selects reads in a FASTA file.

### KASP markers
*QKutilities_KASP_prediction.py* predicts the allele of a KASP marker based on a reference sequence

### Samtools/Bedtools
*QKutilities_genome_coverage.py* reads a genome coverage output from bedtools and performs a window-based analysis of coverage.

### Protein analysis
*QKutilities_protein_analysis.py* reads a peptide FASTA file and uses a scanning window to determine the abundance of individual amino acids.
