Analyzing genome coverage files


Window-based analysis

How to deal with masking?

Plot masking across a sequence? How to deal with this? Window based analysis?

638641459 positions in chromosome 7D

Read original FASTA file to identify if there is an N at the given position?
Only evaluate regions with non repetitive sequence?


for position in fasta file
read a line from genome cov file
based on index of the position
efficient use of memory...

make an initial evaluation of sequence length?


---- 10 March 2017
Need to identify the rate of masking
Similar script for FASTA

Need to expand the script to handle coverage for multiple contigs (easy addition)
